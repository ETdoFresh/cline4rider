# Milestone 1: Initial Setup and Core Features

## Objective
The goal of this milestone is to set up the foundational structure for the plugin and implement a basic sidebar interface. This lays the groundwork for future features and ensures a stable starting point for development.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Project Setup
- **Initialize the Project:**
  - Create a new IntelliJ plugin project.
  - Set up the project structure with clear directories for code, resources, and tests.
  - Define the `plugin.xml` file with initial metadata.
  
- **Configure Dependencies:**
  - Add necessary dependencies for IntelliJ plugin development.
  - Ensure compatibility with target IntelliJ versions (e.g., 2023.x).
  
- **Version Control:**
  - Initialize a Git repository.
  - Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude irrelevant files (e.g., build artifacts, `out/` directory).
  - Push the project to a GitHub repository for version tracking.

### 2. Sidebar Implementation
- **Create a Sidebar Component:**
  - Design a sidebar UI with a placeholder panel using the IntelliJ Swing framework.
  - Ensure the sidebar can pop up, minimize, and reopen via an accessible button or shortcut.
  
- **Integrate into the IDE:**
  - Add the sidebar to IntelliJ's `ToolWindowManager`.
  - Configure the `plugin.xml` to register the sidebar under a unique tool window ID.

- **Set Default Tabs:**
  - Implement placeholder tabs for `Home`, `Tasks`, and `History`.
  - Add a simple navigation system between tabs.

### 3. Basic UI Elements
- **Add Placeholder Content:**
  - Populate each tab with placeholder text or basic UI elements to represent future functionality.
  - Ensure the UI adapts to different IDE themes (light and dark modes).

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Test the sidebar on different screen resolutions and IDE layouts.
  - Ensure resizing works smoothly without breaking the UI.

### 4. Testing and Debugging
- **Local Testing:**
  - Run the plugin in a sandboxed IntelliJ environment to validate the sidebar functionality.
  - Ensure no crashes or performance issues occur during startup or interaction.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement basic error logging for potential UI-related issues.
  - Add meaningful error messages for unimplemented features (e.g., "Feature coming soon").

- **Code Review:**
  - Perform an initial code review to ensure code readability, modularity, and adherence to IntelliJ's best practices.

## Deliverables
- A functioning IntelliJ plugin with:
  - A registered and accessible sidebar tool window.
  - Placeholder tabs for `Home`, `Tasks`, and `History`.
  - Basic navigation between tabs.
- A GitHub repository containing:
  - All project files.
  - A README file describing the project and setup instructions.
- Verified compatibility with the IntelliJ IDE.

---

## Notes
- Prioritize modular and reusable code to streamline future development.
- Maintain detailed documentation of all configurations and decisions to assist with onboarding or debugging.
- Keep testing logs to track issues and solutions encountered during development.
