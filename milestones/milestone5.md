# Milestone 5: AI Integration and Streaming Support

## Objective
The goal of this milestone is to integrate a basic AI model into the plugin, allowing for real-time interactions in the Tasks tab. Additionally, streaming support will be implemented to enable dynamic response rendering.

---

## Tasks

### 1. AI Model Integration
- **Model Setup:**
  - Integrate a predefined AI model (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude) using API calls.
  - Configure API keys and endpoints in a secure and modular way.

- **Request Handling:**
  - Implement a system to send user input from the Tasks tab to the AI model.
  - Parse and handle the AI's response, displaying it in the chat interface.

- **Error Management:**
  - Add robust error handling for scenarios like invalid API keys, rate limits, or network issues.
  - Provide meaningful feedback to the user in case of API errors.

### 2. Streaming Response Support
- **Dynamic Rendering:**
  - Enable streaming support to display AI responses in real-time as they are received from the API.
  - Implement a placeholder for streaming if the AI model does not support it natively.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Ensure smooth rendering of streamed responses without UI lag.
  - Test for edge cases like slow or interrupted streams.

- **User Experience Enhancements:**
  - Add a loading indicator to show when the AI is generating a response.
  - Provide an option to cancel ongoing requests.

### 3. Tasks Tab Functional Enhancements
- **Input-Output Workflow:**
  - Refine the input box to handle multiline commands.
  - Display the input alongside the AI's response in a visually distinct format.

- **Command Execution with AI:**
  - Enable users to send specific commands to the AI for simulated actions (e.g., "Summarize Text" or "Explain Code").
  - Display detailed execution logs in the output.

### 4. Logging and Debugging
- **Interaction Logging:**
  - Record all interactions with the AI, including input, output, and timestamps.
  - Store logs in a local file or database for debugging and review.

- **Debugging Tools:**
  - Add a developer mode toggle to enable verbose logging of API requests and responses.
  - Provide a UI section to view and clear logs.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- **Functional Testing:**
  - Verify the integration with the AI model using both valid and invalid inputs.
  - Test streaming responses with varying lengths and network conditions.

- **Performance Testing:**
  - Evaluate the responsiveness of the chat interface under heavy loads.
  - Ensure the plugin performs well on systems with limited resources.

## Deliverables
- Fully integrated AI model with secure API configuration.
- Tasks tab enhanced with real-time streaming response rendering.
- Functional input-output workflow for user-AI interactions.
- Logging system to track and review interactions.
- Comprehensive error handling and debugging tools.

---

## Notes
- Modularize AI-related components to allow easy swapping or upgrading of models in future iterations.
- Document API integration steps and error codes for future reference.
- Optimize streaming support to ensure a seamless user experience, even with slow or unreliable networks.
