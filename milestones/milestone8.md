# Milestone 8: Settings Integration

## Objective
The goal of this milestone is to fully integrate the Settings tab, allowing users to configure modes, commands, models, and other plugin settings. These configurations should be user-friendly, dynamically applied, and persist across sessions.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Modes Configuration
- **Mode Management UI:**
  - Add a section in the Settings tab to manage modes (e.g., Architect, Code, Ask).
  - Provide options to edit mode-specific rules and permissions (e.g., allowed commands).

- **Dynamic Updates:**
  - Apply changes to modes dynamically without restarting the plugin.
  - Reflect updated mode configurations in the Home and Tasks tabs immediately.

- **Validation:**
  - Ensure all mode configurations are validated for completeness and correctness.

### 2. Command Configuration
- **Command Management UI:**
  - Create a list view in the Settings tab to display all available commands.
  - Add functionality to edit, add, or delete commands.
  - Include fields for command name, description, and parameters.

- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - Ensure any changes to commands are reflected immediately in the Tasks tab.
  - Validate inputs to prevent invalid command configurations.

- **Preset Commands:**
  - Populate the command list with predefined commands as examples or defaults.

### 3. Model Configuration
- **Model Management UI:**
  - Provide an interface in the Settings tab to manage AI models.
  - Allow users to add new models by specifying parameters like name, API key, and endpoint URL.

- **Active Model Selection:**
  - Add a dropdown to select the active model globally or per mode.
  - Display the current model and its details for transparency.

- **Validation:**
  - Validate model configurations for required fields and connectivity (e.g., test API key functionality).

### 4. System Prompt Management
- **Prompt Editing:**
  - Add a section to edit the global system prompt used for AI interactions.
  - Allow for both local and global overrides (e.g., `.systemprompt` file).

- **Preview and Apply:**
  - Provide a preview of the current prompt configuration.
  - Apply changes dynamically to AI interactions without restarting the plugin.

### 5. User Preferences
- **Global Settings:**
  - Add global preferences for settings like theme, auto-sync, and logging level.
  - Store preferences persistently across sessions.

- **Reset to Defaults:**
  - Include a button to reset configurations (modes, commands, models) to their default state.

### 6. Error Handling and Validation
- **Input Validation:**
  - Validate all inputs in the Settings tab for correctness (e.g., no duplicate commands or missing API keys).

- **Error Feedback:**
  - Provide meaningful error messages for invalid configurations.
  - Highlight issues directly in the UI with tooltips or inline messages.

### 7. Testing and Debugging
- **Functional Testing:**
  - Test the Settings tab functionality for managing modes, commands, and models.
  - Verify that changes are reflected dynamically across the plugin.

- **Persistence Testing:**
  - Ensure all settings persist correctly across sessions.

- **Edge Case Testing:**
  - Test with edge cases like empty inputs, duplicate names, or invalid API keys.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional Settings tab with:
  - Mode management for editing and applying rules.
  - Command management for creating, editing, and deleting commands.
  - Model management for adding and selecting AI models.
  - System prompt editing with support for local and global overrides.
  - Global preferences for customizing plugin behavior.
- Dynamic application of all settings without plugin restarts.
- Comprehensive error handling and validation.
- Persistent storage for all configurations across sessions.

---

## Notes
- Maintain modular and extensible code to allow easy addition of new configuration options in future updates.
- Document the Settings tab structure and configuration workflows for both users and developers.
- Ensure the Settings tab is intuitive and consistent with IntelliJâ€™s UI design standards.
