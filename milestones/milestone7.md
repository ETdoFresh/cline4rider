# Milestone 7: External Configuration Sync

## Objective
The aim of this milestone is to implement a system for syncing plugin configurations (models, modes, commands, etc.) from an external JSON file or API. This ensures dynamic updates and flexibility without requiring manual edits or redeployment.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Configuration Framework
- **JSON Structure Design:**
  - Define a clear and extensible JSON schema to represent configurations for:
    - Models (e.g., name, API keys, base URL).
    - Commands (e.g., command names, parameters, and descriptions).
    - Modes (e.g., Architect, Code, Ask, with rules and limitations).

- **Local Parsing:**
  - Create a parser to read the JSON configuration from a local file.
  - Validate the JSON file against the schema, logging any errors.

### 2. Remote Sync Mechanism
- **API Integration:**
  - Implement a mechanism to fetch the JSON configuration from a remote API or URL.
  - Add authentication support if the API requires secure access (e.g., API tokens).

- **Manual and Automatic Sync:**
  - Provide a manual refresh button to sync configurations on demand.
  - Add periodic automatic sync functionality with a configurable interval.

- **Fallback Handling:**
  - If the remote sync fails, fall back to the last successfully fetched configuration or the local file.
  - Display clear feedback to the user when sync fails, including retry options.

### 3. Configuration Application
- **Dynamic Updates:**
  - Apply synced configurations dynamically without restarting the plugin.
  - Ensure changes to models, modes, and commands are reflected immediately in the UI and functionality.

- **Conflict Resolution:**
  - Implement a mechanism to handle conflicts between local and remote configurations.
  - Allow users to prioritize either the local or remote configuration.

### 4. UI Integration
- **Settings Tab Enhancements:**
  - Add a section to display the current configuration source (e.g., local file, remote API).
  - Show the last sync time and status (e.g., success, failure).
  - Provide options to toggle auto-sync and configure the sync interval.

- **Error Feedback:**
  - Display detailed error messages for invalid configurations or sync failures.
  - Add tooltips and contextual help to guide users through resolving issues.

### 5. Testing and Debugging
- **Functional Testing:**
  - Verify the ability to fetch, parse, and apply configurations from both local and remote sources.
  - Test error scenarios such as invalid JSON, unreachable API, or authentication failures.

- **Performance Testing:**
  - Measure the impact of periodic sync on plugin performance.
  - Optimize parsing and application of configurations for large JSON files.

- **Logging:**
  - Log sync activities, including timestamps, errors, and resolutions.
  - Provide a user-accessible log viewer in the Settings tab for debugging.

## Deliverables
- A robust configuration framework supporting local and remote sources.
- Dynamic application of synced configurations without requiring plugin restarts.
- Enhanced Settings tab with sync options and error feedback.
- Thoroughly tested and optimized sync functionality.

---

## Notes
- Ensure compatibility with IntelliJâ€™s plugin guidelines for remote data fetching and storage.
- Modularize the configuration system to allow easy extension for new types of settings in future iterations.
- Document the JSON schema and sync mechanism for developers and users.
