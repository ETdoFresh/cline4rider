## Tasks

### 1. Home Tab Enhancements
- **Dynamic News Feed:**
  - Replace the static news feed with a dynamic system.
  - Fetch content from a remote source (mock API or local server).
  - Implement a refresh button to update the news feed on demand.

- **Improved Input Handling:**
  - Enhance the input box to support multiline input.
  - Add input validation (e.g., disallow empty or overly long submissions).

- **Dropdown Functionality:**
  - Link the dropdown selections to actual state management.
  - Ensure the selected mode and model affect subsequent actions or displays.

### 2. Tasks Tab Enhancements
- **Refined Chat Interface:**
  - Implement a better formatting system for user inputs and responses (e.g., distinguish AI responses with a different style).
  - Support markdown-like syntax in responses (e.g., bold, italics, links).

- **Command Execution:**
  - Simulate real command executions with step-by-step logs.
  - Add mock output to represent results of commands like "Read File" or "Write File."

- **Session Scroll Management:**
  - Enhance scrolling to handle long conversations, including auto-scrolling to the latest entry.
  - Provide a "Scroll to Top" button for easier navigation.

### 3. History Tab Enhancements
- **Session Persistence:**
  - Store session data in a local file or database.
  - Automatically save session updates without user intervention.

- **Enhanced Session Details:**
  - Display a summary of each session, including timestamps and key actions.
  - Add tooltips for session entries to display additional metadata (e.g., duration, number of commands executed).

- **Improved Restore Functionality:**
  - Load session data seamlessly into the Tasks tab.
  - Highlight the restored session in the History tab.

### 4. Error Handling and Validation
- **Enhanced Feedback:**
  - Provide clear, actionable error messages for invalid inputs or actions.
  - Display non-intrusive error notifications within the UI.

- **Validation Improvements:**
  - Add character limits and validation for inputs.
  - Ensure all dropdown and selection changes are reflected properly.

### 5. UI and UX Improvements
- **Theme Optimization:**
  - Refine the UI for better compatibility with IntelliJ's themes (e.g., adaptive colors).
  - Ensure all tabs and elements have consistent styling.

- **Responsiveness:**
  - Test and optimize layouts for different screen sizes.
  - Handle resizing dynamically without breaking UI components.

- **Interactivity:**
  - Add hover effects, animations, and transitions to improve user experience.
