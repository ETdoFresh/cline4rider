# Milestone 3: Basic Functionality Implementation

## Objective
The goal of this milestone is to enhance the tabs created in Milestone 2 with interactive elements and implement core functionality placeholders. This milestone ensures that the interface is operational and ready for future integration with backend systems.

## Tasks

### 1. Home Tab Functionalities
- **News Feed:**
  - Integrate a simple placeholder news feed.
  - Fetch static content from a local JSON file or predefined values to simulate dynamic updates.

- **User Input Handling:**
  - Enable the input box to accept user commands.
  - Implement basic parsing of user input and display mock responses.

- **Dropdown Behavior:**
  - Add functionality to the dropdowns for mode and model selection.
  - Display the selected values in a label or log area for feedback.

### 2. Tasks Tab Functionalities
- **Interactive Chat Interface:**
  - Allow the user to input text and display it in the output area.
  - Simulate AI responses using predefined responses based on user input patterns.

- **Command Execution Placeholder:**
  - Create a log panel to display executed command placeholders.
  - Add buttons or triggers for mock commands like "Read File," "Write File," and "Execute Command."

- **Scrolling and Input Layout:**
  - Ensure that the chat interface is scrollable and maintains input at the bottom.
  - Test usability and responsiveness for long sessions.

### 3. History Tab Functionalities
- **Session Management:**
  - Store user input and mock responses as session data.
  - Display session summaries (e.g., initial user input) in the session list.

- **Restore Session:**
  - Allow clicking on a session entry to reload the corresponding data into the Tasks tab.
  - Ensure smooth transition and display of restored session content.

- **Delete Session:**
  - Implement actual deletion of session data with confirmation.
  - Reflect changes immediately in the UI.

### 4. Error Handling
- **User Feedback:**
  - Add error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., empty command submission).
  - Display user-friendly messages in the Tasks and Home tabs.

- **Logging:**
  - Create a basic logging mechanism to track user actions and errors for debugging.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional Home tab with user input handling, dropdown interaction, and a mock news feed.
- Interactive Tasks tab with a working chat interface and command execution placeholders.
- Operational History tab with session storage, restoration, and deletion functionality.
- Error messages and a basic logging mechanism.

---

## Notes
- Use local storage or a temporary in-memory database to manage session data until a persistent backend is integrated.
- Ensure modularity in input handling and session management to support future enhancements.
- Test all functionalities for edge cases, including invalid inputs and long session data.
