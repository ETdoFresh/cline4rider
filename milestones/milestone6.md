# Milestone 6: Command Execution and Validation

## Objective
The goal of this milestone is to implement functionality for executing predefined commands within the Tasks tab. This includes simulating execution, managing outputs, and ensuring robust validation and feedback mechanisms.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Command Framework
- **Define Commands:**
  - Create a list of predefined commands (e.g., "Read File," "Write File," "Execute Script").
  - Store commands and their parameters in a structured format (e.g., JSON or an in-memory data structure).

- **Command Execution Flow:**
  - Implement a handler to process command inputs and simulate execution.
  - Provide feedback for successful and failed executions through the UI.

### 2. User Interaction
- **Command Input:**
  - Add a dropdown or input field in the Tasks tab for selecting and entering commands.
  - Enable parameter input for commands (e.g., file paths, custom text).

- **Execution Log:**
  - Display command execution logs in the chat interface, with timestamps and status indicators.
  - Highlight errors or warnings in the logs for better visibility.

- **Cancel Command Option:**
  - Allow users to cancel ongoing commands with a dedicated button.

### 3. Command Simulation
- **Mock Outputs:**
  - Simulate outputs for predefined commands, including success and error scenarios.
  - Use realistic mock data to enhance the user experience.

- **Execution Steps:**
  - Display step-by-step progress for longer-running commands.
  - Add a progress bar or animation to indicate ongoing execution.

### 4. Validation and Error Handling
- **Input Validation:**
  - Validate user inputs for commands to prevent invalid executions.
  - Display specific error messages for incorrect parameters or unsupported commands.

- **Error Recovery:**
  - Allow users to retry failed commands with updated inputs.
  - Log errors in a separate section for review and debugging.

### 5. UI Enhancements
- **Command Execution Panel:**
  - Design a dedicated panel in the Tasks tab for managing commands.
  - Include options for viewing history, clearing logs, and customizing commands.

- **Theming and Responsiveness:**
  - Ensure all new UI components adapt to IntelliJâ€™s light and dark themes.
  - Optimize layouts for different screen sizes and resolutions.

### 6. Testing and Debugging
- **Functional Testing:**
  - Verify execution flow for all predefined commands.
  - Test edge cases, such as invalid inputs and interrupted executions.

- **Performance Testing:**
  - Measure the responsiveness of the command execution interface under heavy usage.
  - Optimize the simulation engine for efficiency.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional command execution framework with predefined commands.
- Interactive UI for managing and executing commands in the Tasks tab.
- Detailed execution logs with error handling and feedback.
- Robust validation mechanisms to ensure reliable user interactions.
- Optimized UI components with seamless theme support and responsiveness.

---

## Notes
- Use modular and extensible code to support the addition of new commands in future iterations.
- Maintain detailed documentation of commands, including usage examples and error codes.
- Consider user feedback to prioritize the implementation of additional commands or features.
