# Milestone 2: Tab Navigation and Basic Layout

## Objective
The aim of this milestone is to implement a fully functional tab navigation system and basic layouts for the Home, Tasks, and History tabs. This milestone builds on the foundational setup to create a cohesive interface with navigable components.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Tab Navigation System
- **Create Navigation Structure:**
  - Implement a tab-based navigation system using IntelliJ's Swing framework.
  - Ensure smooth transitions between tabs without losing state.

- **Tab Management:**
  - Dynamically manage tabs, ensuring proper cleanup when switching or closing tabs.
  - Highlight the active tab for better user experience.

- **Integration:**
  - Connect the navigation system to the sidebar created in Milestone 1.

### 2. Home Tab Implementation
- **News Section:**
  - Add a placeholder for a news feed with sample text or static content.
  - Reserve space for dynamic updates in future milestones.

- **Input Box:**
  - Include an input box for user commands or requests.
  - Add placeholder functionality for handling user input.

- **Dropdowns:**
  - Add dropdown menus for selecting:
    - **Mode:** (e.g., Ask, Architect, Code).
    - **Model:** Preconfigured options (placeholder values).

### 3. Tasks Tab Implementation
- **Basic Chat Interface:**
  - Design a placeholder chat interface with input and output areas.
  - Ensure input is at the bottom, with a scrollable output view above.

- **Command Execution Placeholder:**
  - Add a placeholder for command execution logs or actions.

### 4. History Tab Implementation
- **Session Listing:**
  - Create a placeholder list of past sessions with sample titles.
  - Allow clicking on an item to navigate to the associated session (mock behavior).

- **Delete Option:**
  - Add a delete/trash icon for each session entry.
  - Display a confirmation dialog before deletion (mock functionality).

### 5. UI Enhancements
- **Theming Support:**
  - Ensure the tabs and their content adapt to IntelliJ’s light and dark themes.

- **Responsive Layout:**
  - Test the interface on different screen sizes and IDE layouts to ensure usability.

## Deliverables
- A sidebar with:
  - Fully functional tab navigation.
  - Basic Home, Tasks, and History tabs.
- Functional placeholders for:
  - News section, input box, and dropdowns in the Home tab.
  - Chat interface in the Tasks tab.
  - Session list and delete option in the History tab.
- Verified adaptability to IntelliJ’s themes and layouts.

## Notes
- Maintain a modular structure for tabs to facilitate future expansions.
- Document the navigation system and basic tab layouts to simplify onboarding for future developers.
- Record UI testing results, including edge cases for navigation and resizing.
